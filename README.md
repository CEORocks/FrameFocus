**FrameFocus** helps automate the task of trimming visual clutter from your videos by intelligently detecting the subject and cropping everything else. Whether you're repurposing content for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram Reels, FrameFocus saves time and improves framing without requiring manual work.

Built for content creators, developers, and editors who need quick results with precision.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Sample Analysis** ‚Äì Selects multiple frames from the video to understand layout.
2. **Background Isolation** ‚Äì Identifies plain-colored backgrounds to separate content.
3. **Subject Focus** ‚Äì Pinpoints the portion of the video with the most visual information.
4. **Aspect Ratio Mapping** ‚Äì Adjusts the crop zone to fit a standard output size.
5. **Final Processing** ‚Äì Uses FFmpeg to generate the cropped video with audio options.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- FFmpeg (install via `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS or your platform's package manager)

---

## üí° Notes

FrameFocus performs best with videos that have clear separation between content and background. Results may vary with highly dynamic or complex footage. For consistent results, use videos with plain borders or obvious framing.
